# PokemonStatsDB

This repository contains the **PokemonStatsDB.sql** file, created as part of a seminar assignment for **Khan Academy**.  

## Project Description
The task was to pick or create a dataset and then use advanced `SELECT` queries to explore the data. The goal is to think about the kinds of questions one might ask about the dataset if it were used in an app or a business idea.  

## Assignment Requirements
The queries should help answer questions such as:  

- What are the **average, maximum, and minimum** values in the data?  
- What about those numbers **per category** in the data (using `HAVING`)?  
- What ways are there to **group the data** that donâ€™t exist yet (using `CASE`)?  
- What interesting ways are there to **filter the data** (using `AND/OR`)?  

## How to Use
